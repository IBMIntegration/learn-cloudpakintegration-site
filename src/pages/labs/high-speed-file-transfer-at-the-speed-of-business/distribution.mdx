## Distribute Content to End Users Using Aspera on Cloud

We have seen that we are able to push our content to the cloud and then once in the cloud
we can move it around. What happens when we need to access, modify or deliver that content
to others? Let's take a look at an application available in Aspera on Cloud called
`Packages`.

The AoC Packages app allows us to package up content and send it like an email but of
course at maximum speeds and with no file size limitations. We also have the flexibility
of sending the content from anywhere in the world (ICOS Dallas & S3 Frankfurt as an
example in this case).

We know our file now resides in AWS S3 in Frankfurt. Lets create a package with this file
as the contents and send it to ourselves via email.

## Lets Go

1. Switch to the Aspera on Cloud Packages App using the App Switcher in the toolbar at the
   top-right of the screen.

1. Select the 'Send Files' button to open the Send Files form to begin composing a
   package.

1. Complete the required fields in the `Send Files` form:

   - **To:** This is where an email will be sent with the link to download the content you
     are about to send. You can enter your IBM ID you used to log in to Aspera on Cloud
     and you will be able to view the package in the `My Inbox` tab in the left panel on
     the page. Note: Entering an external email address has been disabled for this lab.
   - **Subject:** Enter an email subject
   - **Upload:** Here you can choose the contents of the package. Select `Upload` and then
     select `Upload from Files`. You can now select your file from IBM ICOS or AWS S3 and
     add it to the package.

   Note: If adding multiple sources, e.g. local filesystem, IBM ICOS and AWS S3 the files
   will each be uploaded to central storage to compose the package.

1. Click `Send`. As always you can select the `Transfer Monitor` from the toolbar to view
   the status of the transfers.

1. Once the package has been uploaded and delivered you will see the package available in
   `My Inbox` located in the left navigation bar of the Packages application. Note: An
   email would have been sent to your IBM ID email too but we don't have access to that
   with these demo accounts.

<InlineNotification kind="warning">
  Because sending to external email accounts has been disabled in this lesson you will not
  be able to follow along with the next two steps.
</InlineNotification>

1. When a package has been delivered the end user will receive an email with a link to the
   package.

   **Note:** This is the bare bones email template. This template can be customised.

1. Open the package by clicking the `Open IBM Aspera on Cloud` button and you will be
   taken to the package view page where you can download the package.

## Recap

In this section we created a new Package and sent it to ourselves directly from AWS S3 in
Frankfurt to the end device we use to download the package using the link we received in
our email.

## The End

Congratulations you have finished the lab.
