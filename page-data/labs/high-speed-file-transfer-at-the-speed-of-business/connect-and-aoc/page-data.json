Another option is to use the `Aspera Connect` client\napplication.\n\nAspera Connect is designed to allow easy FASP uploads and downloads using the browser.\nLets now use the Aspera Connect Client to download the file that contains the token we\nneed for the next section of this lab.\n\n## Access Aspera on Cloud\n\n1. Navigate back to Aspera on Cloud and ensure you are still logged in\n\n   ![Bookmark](./images/aoc-download-bookmark.png)\n\n1. Navigate into the `lab5352-secrets` directory by selecting the folder\n\n   ![Lab5352 Secrets](./images/aoc-download-lab5352secrets.png)\n\n1. Select the checkbox for the file `lab5352_secret.txt` and select `Download`\n\n   ![Lab5352 Secrets](./images/aoc-download-download-file.png)\n\n   **Note:** The first time connecting to a remote node using Aspera Connect you will be\n   asked to accept the connection that is being made. Select `Allow` and your download\n   will begin.\n\n   ![Allow Connection](./images/aoc-download-allow-connection.png)\n\n1. The Aspera Connect application will open and display the progress of the transfer\n\n   ![Explain Connect](./images/aoc-download-connect-explain.png)\n\n   - 1: Adjust transfer speeds in realtime\n   - 2: Open containing folder\n   - 3: Stop and start transfer\n\n   **Note:** If the Aspera Connect Client window is not focussed you can select the icon\n   in the toolbar to bring it into focus.\n\n   ![Focus Connect](./images/aoc-download-connect-toolbar.png)\n\n   Once complete the file `lab5352_secret.txt` will be available in `/home/ibmuser`. You\n   will use this in the next section.\n\n## Recap\n\nAspera on Cloud makes it easy for you to get access to your files no matter where they are\nlocated in the world. In this section of the tutorial you used the Aspera Connect Client\nto download a file hosted in AWS S3 Toronto using a browser based client.\n\nNow you have that token you can go back and use the Aspera API to initiate a remote\ntransfer between the Kubernetes environment and Aspera on Cloud.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"796167b90b71d7b2b03e958176501fac","counter":147,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Aspera Connect & AoC","description":"Think Lab 5352 - Aspera Connect & AoC","tabs":["Prerequisites","CLI","Client & CP4I","Connect & AoC","Node API","Cloud to Cloud","Distribution"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Aspera Connect & AoC\ndescription: Think Lab 5352 - Aspera Connect & AoC\ntabs:\n  [\n    'Prerequisites',\n    'CLI',\n    'Client & CP4I',\n    'Connect & AoC',\n    'Node API',\n    'Cloud to Cloud',\n    'Distribution',\n  ]\n---\n\nexport const Title = () => <span>High Speed File Transfer at the Speed of Business</span>\n\n<h2 style={{color: 'red'}}>DRAFT</h2>\n\n## Downloading from Aspera on Cloud with the Aspera Connect Client\n\nYou are now familiar with two methods of initiating an Aspera transfer; using the CLI and\nusing the native Aspera Client.
