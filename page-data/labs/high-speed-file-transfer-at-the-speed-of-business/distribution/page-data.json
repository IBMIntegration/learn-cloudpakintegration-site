What happens when we need to access, modify or deliver that content\nto others? Let's take a look at an application available in Aspera on Cloud called\n`Packages`.\n\nThe AoC Packages app allows us to package up content and send it like an email but of\ncourse at maximum speeds and with no file size limitations. We also have the flexibility\nof sending the content from anywhere in the world (ICOS Dallas & S3 Frankfurt as an\nexample in this case).\n\nWe know our file now resides in AWS S3 in Frankfurt. Lets create a package with this file\nas the contents and send it to ourselves via email.\n\n## Lets Go\n\n1. Switch to the Aspera on Cloud Packages App using the App Switcher in the toolbar at the\n   top-right of the screen.\n\n   ![App Switcher](./images/aoc-package-change-to-packages.png)\n\n1. Select the 'Send Files' button to open the Send Files form to begin composing a\n   package.\n\n   ![Send Files](./images/aoc-package-send-files.png)\n\n1. Complete the required fields in the `Send Files` form:\n\n   - **To:** This is where an email will be sent with the link to download the content you\n     are about to send. You can enter your IBM ID you used to log in to Aspera on Cloud\n     and you will be able to view the package in the `My Inbox` tab in the left panel on\n     the page. Note: Entering an external email address has been disabled for this lab.\n   - **Subject:** Enter an email subject\n   - **Upload:** Here you can choose the contents of the package. Select `Upload` and then\n     select `Upload from Files`. You can now select your file from IBM ICOS or AWS S3 and\n     add it to the package.\n\n   Note: If adding multiple sources, e.g. local filesystem, IBM ICOS and AWS S3 the files\n   will each be uploaded to central storage to compose the package.\n\n   ![Send Form Complete](./images/aoc-package-send-form.png)\n\n1. Click `Send`. As always you can select the `Transfer Monitor` from the toolbar to view\n   the status of the transfers.\n\n1. Once the package has been uploaded and delivered you will see the package available in\n   `My Inbox` located in the left navigation bar of the Packages application. Note: An\n   email would have been sent to your IBM ID email too but we don't have access to that\n   with these demo accounts.\n\n   ![My Inbox View](./images/aoc-package-my-inbox.png)\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">\n  Because sending to external email accounts has been disabled in this lesson you will not\n  be able to follow along with the next two steps.\n</InlineNotification>\n\n1.

This template can be customised.\n\n1. Open the package by clicking the `Open IBM Aspera on Cloud` button and you will be\n   taken to the package view page where you can download the package.\n\n   ![Package Download](./images/aoc-package-download-page.png)\n\n## Recap\n\nIn this section we created a new Package and sent it to ourselves directly from AWS S3 in\nFrankfurt to the end device we use to download the package using the link we received in\nour email.\n\n## The End\n\nCongratulations you have finished the lab.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"ad8500da133280fcdfb1eee988faf547","counter":150,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Distribution with AoC","description":"Think Lab 5352 - Distribution with AoC","tabs":["Prerequisites","CLI","Client & CP4I","Connect & AoC","Node API","Cloud to Cloud","Distribution"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Distribution with AoC\ndescription: Think Lab 5352 - Distribution with AoC\ntabs:\n  [\n    'Prerequisites',\n    'CLI',\n    'Client & CP4I',\n    'Connect & AoC',\n    'Node API',\n    'Cloud to Cloud',\n    'Distribution',\n  ]\n---\n\nexport const Title = () => <span>High Speed File Transfer at the Speed of Business</span>\n\n<h2 style={{color: 'red'}}>DRAFT</h2>\n\n## Distribute Content to End Users Using Aspera on Cloud\n\nWe have seen that we are able to push our content to the cloud and then once in the cloud\nwe can move it around.
