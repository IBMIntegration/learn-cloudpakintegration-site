As you know most of the time we are dealing with\nmultiple cloud providers, we need to make it easy to move data between them. In this\nsection you will move your file from IBM Cloud Object Storage in Dallas to AWS S3 Storage\nin Frankfurt.\n\n## Lets Go\n\n1. Navigate to the `IBM ICOS - Dallas` folder so you can see the file you just sent to the\n   cloud.\n\n1. Select the `split view` button in the toolbar at the top-right of the page to open\n   another pane to the right of your existing view.\n\n   ![Split View](./images/aoc-n2n-split-view.png)\n\n1. Select the `AWS S3 - Frankfurt` directory\n\n   ![Open AWS Frankfurt](./images/aoc-n2n-open-aws.png)\n\n1. Drag and drop your file from the IBM ICOS Dallas storage in the left pane to the AWS S3\n   Frankfurt storage in the right pane to initiate a cloud-to-cloud transfer. Once you\n   drop your file into the right pane you will be notified that a copy has begun.\n\n   Note: You can hold `alt` when dropping to perform a `move` rather than a `copy`.\n\n   ![Copy Files Notification](./images/aoc-n2n-copying-files.png)\n\n1. View the status of the transfer by selecting the `Transfer Monitor` button from the\n   toolbar.\n\n   ![Transfer Monitor](./images/aoc-n2n-transfer-monitor.png)\n\n## Recap\n\nYou have now successfully copied your file between clouds from IBM ICOS in Dallas to AWS\nS3 in Frankfurt. Its important to note that Aspera does not modify or store these files in\nany proprietary way. Other services or processes running in the cloud can easily access\nthe contents of these buckets.\n\nYou have one more section to go. Let's take a look at how you might distribute large\namounts of data to end-users.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"25002975910f615d153860ae46804be9","counter":148,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cloud to Cloud Transfer","description":"Think Lab 5352 - Cloud to Cloud Transfer","tabs":["Prerequisites","CLI","Client & CP4I","Connect & AoC","Node API","Cloud to Cloud","Distribution"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Cloud to Cloud Transfer\ndescription: Think Lab 5352 - Cloud to Cloud Transfer\ntabs:\n  [\n    'Prerequisites',\n    'CLI',\n    'Client & CP4I',\n    'Connect & AoC',\n    'Node API',\n    'Cloud to Cloud',\n    'Distribution',\n  ]\n---\n\nexport const Title = () => <span>High Speed File Transfer at the Speed of Business</span>\n\n<h2 style={{color: 'red'}}>DRAFT</h2>\n\n## Move Content between Two Different Cloud Providers\n\nYou now have your data in the cloud.
