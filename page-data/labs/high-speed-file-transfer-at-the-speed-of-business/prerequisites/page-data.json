Throughout this lab we will use a single\nfile and move it between cloud, on-premises and home network environments. Each movement\nof the file will use a different method of initiating a transfer so you can become\nfamiliar with what options you have available to you.\n\nBelow is an overview of the environment we will be using for this Lab.\n\n![Aspera Stack](./images/overview.png)\n\nYou don't have to understand where and how all of these components work together to create\na hybrid cloud file transfer solution just yet, that's the purpose of this Lab. A brief\ndescription:\n\n- On-Premises Developer machine: This is where we will be doing most of our work, we will\n  use it for:\n  - The native Aspera Client installed\n  - Access to the\n    [Cloud Pak for Integration](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-pak-for-integration)\n    OpenShift cluster\n  - Connecting to the Aspera on Cloud SaaS\n  - Any other tasks...\n- IBM Cloud, Aspera on Cloud: A SaaS implementation of Aspera that offers a unique User\n  Interface, access to the Aspera High Speed Transfer Service in all major cloud and IBM\n  Cloud Object Storage.\n- AWS: We will use the Aspera High Speed Transfer Service to connect directly to S3\n  storage in AWS.\n- Demo Server: An Aspera Demo Server that can be used to test/trial FASP transfers with\n  clients. This demo server comes configured by default as a connection when installing\n  the Aspera Client.\n- Client?\n\nBy the end of this Lab you will understand the multitude of options you have available to\nyou to move content easily between these components.\n\n**Note:** Please keep in mind that for most if not all of these file movements there are\nmultiple ways in which each transfer could be done. At the end of the day FASP is a\ntransport layer technology and everything built on-top offers different ways of invoking\nthat protocol.\n\nThis lab will be broken into steps that follow a journey of a file originating in the\nAspera Demo Server through the Aspera Client, The CP4I Cluster, AoC ICOS storage, AWS S3\nand then delivered to an end client.\n\nPlease complete the following prerequisite tasks in 'Preparing the lab environment' before\nmoving on with the lab.\n\n<Accordion>\n  <AccordionItem title=\"Preparing the lab environment\">\n    <Preparing />\n  </AccordionItem>\n  <AccordionItem title=\"Troubleshooting\">\n    <Troubleshooting />\n  </AccordionItem>\n</Accordion>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"ee8776db1e2dc6698eec07674842c8e4","counter":155,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Prerequisites","description":"Think Lab 5352 - Prerequisites","tabs":["Prerequisites","CLI","Client & CP4I","Connect & AoC","Node API","Cloud to Cloud","Distribution"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Prerequisites\ndescription: Think Lab 5352 - Prerequisites\ntabs:\n  [\n    'Prerequisites',\n    'CLI',\n    'Client & CP4I',\n    'Connect & AoC',\n    'Node API',\n    'Cloud to Cloud',\n    'Distribution',\n  ]\n---\n\nimport Preparing from './prerequisite-preparing.mdx'\nimport Troubleshooting from './prerequisite-troubleshooting.mdx'\nexport const Title = () => <span>High Speed File Transfer at the Speed of Business</span>\n\n<h2 style={{color: 'red'}}>DRAFT</h2>\n\n## Lab Overview\n\nThe objective of this lab is to help you understand the various ways in which Aspera can\nhelp you move your data in a hybrid environment.
